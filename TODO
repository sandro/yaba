decide on whether I want to use railify or some sort of baseapp
  I like railify because it gives me edge
  I like baseapp because everything is installed and nice
    baseapp should include a rake task which resets the git repo

After bootstrapping the database, you'll need to make at least one
edit to the code. In config/environment.rb, you need to specify a
new secret for the cookie session storage. Change line 41 of
config/environment.rb, replacing the secret with the one generated
by this command:

rake secret
