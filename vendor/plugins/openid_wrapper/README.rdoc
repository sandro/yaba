= OpenidWrapper


Thin OpenID Consumer Wrapper for Ruby on Rails using ruby-openid gem.


== SHORT STORY

It helps to keep your session controller nice and clean and provides
some handy methods such as begin_openid, complete_openid and openid_params.


== LONG STORY

The goal is to have openid consumer wrapper, what follows more closely 
the spirit of OpenID spec and the same time provides some handy methods. 

No more you need squeezed openid through one method as in the original plugin, 
enjoy same clarity as you will find in OpenID spec, so it means when you start request
then you just use method begin_openid (aliased to create_openid) and when you complete
your request, then use method complete_openid. 

note: this wrapper is made openid only in mind, so that's why it
might not be the quickest fit for you if you also need old way of 
username-password authentication, however they play nice together if you want so. 


= Installation

NB! OPENID WRAPPER IS BETA, SO NO GEM YET!
I pushed it up with git for people who would like to review the code and give 
some ideas to improve this initial stuff. 

First you need Rails 2.1.0 or newer.

Start with:

  sudo gem install openid-wrapper

Add to config/environment.rb:

  config.gem 'openid_wrapper'

Add to config/routes.rb:
  
  map.resources :users

  # unfortunatly OpenID spec does not honor RESTful design,
  # so we need complete action as well.
  map.resources :sessions, :collection => {:complete => :get}

  # some handy shortcuts, you can use as link_to 'Signup', signup_path
  map.signup '/signup', :controller => 'users', :action => 'new'
  map.login '/login', :controller => 'sessions', :action => 'new'
  map.logout '/logout', :controller => 'sessions', :action => 'destroy'

Add to app/controller/sessions_controller.rb # Look how slim and clean controller :-)
  def create
    begin_openid
  end

  def complete
    complete_openid
  end

Add to app/views/users/new.html.haml:

  - form_tag sessions_path do
    = text_field_tag :openid_identifier
    = submit_tag 'Login'


== Additional Tips and Notes

* Make OpenID identifier field more nuby friendly and 
add OpenID official selector from https://www.idselector.com/

* OpenID Wrapper will generate log entry:
  ** openid_wrapper: initialized properly.
